# Owlbear Rodeo Token Descriptions Extension

Hello! This is my first project in developing a third-party extension for the VTT Owlbear Rodeo.

With this extension, you gain the ability to add descriptions to tokens and allow them to be visible to other players in the same room. 

Ultimately, this is a tool designed for GMs, allowing them to add descriptions to tokens for notes or convenience. However, players with permissions will be able to add descriptions to their own tokens.

If you have the permissions (GM's get access to everything), when you click on a token in its Context Menu there will be an option called "Edit Notes". When you click on that, a popover will appear that is the interface to add descriptions. There are 2 boxes, one for public descriptions and one for private notes. You write as you please to each box. Ensure that you click on the Save button below to save your writing.

There is a small check box for allowing others to view your public description. By checking that box, a new option will appear in the token's Context Menu called "View Description" (others can see it too), and when you click on it a new popover will display with the Public Description of the token. Private Notes will never show.

There is one more option in the Edit Notes window, at the very bottom is a button saying "Show Everyone". When you click that, it will force everyone else in the room to essentially "View Description" for that token. This is a way to broadcast the description for everyone when you want them to see it. 

One way that I use this tool for is to make a map interactable in a way by strategically placing down tokens with descriptions for each relevant area.
